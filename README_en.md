# INF5171 // Concurrent and Parallel Programming

In the INF5171 course, I study concurrent and parallel programming, exploring multi-core architectures, synchronization, and parallel task management. I learn to use tools such as Pthreads and OpenMP to develop high-performance programs. The course also covers GPU computing and the use of libraries like MPI.
